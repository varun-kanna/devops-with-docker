# Exercise 1.16: Cloud deployment

It is time to wrap up this part and run a containerized app in the cloud.

You can take any web-app, eg. an example or exercise from this part, your own app, or even the course material (see devopsdockeruh/coursepage) and deploy it to some cloud provider.

There are plenty of alternatives, and most provide a free tier. Here are some alternatives that are quite simple to use:

fly.io (easy to use but needs a credit card even in the free tier)
render.com (bad documentation, you most likely need google)
heroku.com (has a free student plan through GitHub Student Developer Pack)
If you know a good cloud service for the purposes of this exercise, please tell us (yes, we know about Amazon AWS, Google Cloud and Azure already... ).

Submit the Dockerfile, a brief description of what you did, and a link to the running app.
