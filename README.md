This course provides an introduction to container technologies, with a particular focus on Docker and container orchestration using Docker Compose. Containers are a lightweight, portable way to package and deploy software applications. Throughout the course, we'll explore the various components of web services, such as reverse proxies and databases, and how they can be deployed using Docker.

Please note that due to technical limitations, Docker cannot be installed on Department of Computer Science computers. As a result, you will need to use your own computer to follow the examples and complete the exercises in this course. [Course Link](https://devopswithdocker.com/)

## Prerequisites

To be successful in this course, attendees should have access to a computer with admin/superuser privileges.
